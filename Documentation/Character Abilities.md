### Default abilities:
- Walking (duh)
- Jump. Likely to have somewhat floaty gravity and air control
- Melee Attack. They either use a free hand or bash in front of them with their weapon

### Chip Abilities:
- Dash: A horizontal dash, directed based on which WASD keys are being pressed
- Directional Dash: may be combined with the basic dash, dashes but with respect to the pitch of the camera. If separate from the basic dash, it'll move a shorter distance than its basic counterpart
- Slide: A slide that starts fast but very quickly slows down to walking speed, then stays that speed until the character hits an obstacle
- Gound Slam: Pressing the slide button in the air causes the character to slam straight down, creating a non-damaging shockwave that knocks enemies away
